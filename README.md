# Algorithmic Problems Solutions
This repository contains my solutions to some algorithmic assignments that I receive during my studies.

## Problems
Descriptions of each tasks are in the files called "The task description".
The solution files contain comments explaining the operation of the most important lines of code.
Sample tests can be found in comments at the end of the solution files.
