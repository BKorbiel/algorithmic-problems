The task is to find a 2D subarray whose sum is the largest. This sum cannot be negative - if all the elements in the array are less 
than zero then the maximum subarray is empty and the sum is 0. The program should run in O(max(n, m)^3) time (n and m are the 
number of rows and columns). The output should be the maximum sum and the indices i, j, k, l of the subarray, where 'i' and 'j' are 
row numbers, and 'k' and 'l' are column numbers where the subarray starts and ends, respectively. If there are multiple subarrays 
with the maximum sum, return the one with the least number of elements. If there are multiple such subarrays, return the one whose 
indices i, j, k, l form the lexicographically smallest sequence."
