The task is to find out how many numbers from a given ordered set of data are contained in a given range. This should be
done with O(log N) time complexity and O(1) memory complexity. After that the program should output the number of different
numbers in the data set.

Input:
Data to the program is read from the standard input. The first value provided is the number of data sets, after which the 
input will contain the specified number of data sets. Each data set contains the following information: the number of data in 
the array being inputed. The array is in non-decreasing order. Then the array is inputed, which is the long integer numbers in 
the amount equal to the previously inputed number. Next is the number of queries. For each query two numbers are given that 
define the range of values for which the program should answer the question of how many numbers in the array are contained in 
that range.

Output:
For each data set:
For each given range of values the program should output the answer on how many numbers from the array are contained in that 
range. The number of different numbers in the array should be printed on the last line.
