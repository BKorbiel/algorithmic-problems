The task is to write a recursive function that uses the median of medians algorithm to find the k-th sequentially 
ordered number (in ascending order) in an unsorted dataset. The program should have a constant memory complexity 
and linear time complexity.

Input:
The first input value will be a positive integer z (1 ≤ z ≤ 100), indicating the number of data sets. 
Each data set contains the following:
An integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), representing the length of the array.
n integers a (0 ≤ a ≤ 10^6), which are the elements of the array.
An integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100), indicating the number of queries for a specific element.
m integers k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^6), each representing the k-th element of the array to be found.

Output:
For each data set, the program outputs m lines, each containing one of two options:
• The number k followed by the value of the k-th element of the array in non-decreasing order, 
separated by a space - if such an element exists.
• The number k followed by the word "none" separated by a space - if such an element does not exist.
